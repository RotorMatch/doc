# What is RotorMatch

**RotorMatch** is a drone racing platform where organizers can manage their events.

We want to help organizers to build their events more easily by creating a simple but yet powerful service for them.

Our mission is to make a user-friendly and collaborative product for everyone to create, manage and share drone racing events.
